# Evolutionary IOF
This repository contains an Evolutionary Ising Optimization Framework (IOF) based on a physics-inspired Ising algorithm combined with a hybrid annealing scheme.

To run simulations of Ising-spin swarm evolution, please execute IOF_run.py. The framework supports a variety of benchmark problems, including G-set graphs, square lattices, Möbius ladder lattices, triangular lattices, and cubic lattices.

For all problem instances, the corresponding ground states (best-known solutions) are provided for performance comparison.

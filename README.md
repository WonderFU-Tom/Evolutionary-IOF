# Evolutionary IOF

An Evolutionary Ising Optimization Framework (IOF) based on a physics-inspired Ising system and a hybrid annealing scheme.  
This project is licensed under the terms of the MIT license. Please run `IOF_run.py` to simulate the Ising-spin swarm evolution on G-set graphs, square lattices, MÃ¶bius-ladder lattices, triangular lattices, and cubic lattices. The ground states (best-known solutions) for all problems have been recorded for comparison.
